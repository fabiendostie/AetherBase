 Create broad, descriptive folders and use subfolders to break down content further, for example, organizing photos under Media > Photos > Year > Event.
 Limit folder depth to three to five levels to maintain manageability and ease of navigation.

Adopt a consistent naming convention using clear, descriptive names and standardized formats like ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) to improve sorting and searchability.
 For instance, use names like "Project_Report_2025-10-30".
