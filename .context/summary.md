## Context Compression Strategy

Following TELIS principles for maintaining coherent context in long tasks:

### Summarization Triggers

- Every 10 significant code changes
- After major architectural decisions
- At end of each development sprint
- When context window utilization exceeds 70%

### Compression Techniques

1. **Bullet Point Summaries**: Condensed decision rationale
2. **Reference Links**: Point to detailed docs rather than duplicating
3. **Symbolic Encoding**: Use shorthand for repeated concepts
4. **Tiered Detail**: High-level summary with expandable sections

## Essential Context Preservation

**Critical Information to Always Include**:

- Project goals and constraints
- Current architecture patterns
- Active development context
- Blocking issues and dependencies
- Recent significant changes

**Information to Prune**:

- Resolved issues (keep reference links only)
- Superseded decisions
- Outdated implementation details
- Verbose explanations (compress to essentials)

---

## Context Injection Guidelines

When resuming work or starting new sessions:

1. **Load Summary First** (this document)
2. **Check Active Tasks** (from task tracking system)
3. **Review Recent Decisions** (decision log above)
4. **Scan Open Issues** (known issues section)
5. **Progressive Detail** (request specific shards as needed)

This prevents context overload while ensuring coherence.
